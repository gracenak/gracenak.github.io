I have spent my whole life devoting myself to music. From the age of 5, I have spent countless hours practicing the violin, rehearsing, and performing. Music has been my lifelong passion but has limited my time and energy to other interests and hobbies. The path to becoming a professional musician has been an arduous road of love, sweat, and tears but has continued to be a devotion worthy of its time. So, why have I decided to venture into the world of coding?

I am a 30 year old, classically trained musician. In addition to being a performer, I teach music privately and at the public schools. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the symphony was shut down and the schools were closed. I was no longer able to perform and I was no longer able to go into the schools to teach my students. Life as we knew it had become a virtual reality. 

How was I going to be able to make music with my friends and colleagues? How was I going to be able to teach my students? The world was not prepared for this and I was limited in my knowledge and resources. My colleagues and I commiserated in the struggles we faced in virtual performance and teaching. We explored the available resources but there were always road blocks and limitations to what we needed. 

As of now, I do not know the fate of the symphony. Many orchestras have no vision in end as to what is to come next. We already struggle with the notion that classical music is a dying genre. If we do not continue to celebrate classical music in our lives and education, it will become a faded memory. I have longed to build a bridge between the past and future for quite some time. We live in a digital world and it is our duty to make classical music and education accessible to all audiences.

I'm just finishing up my "First Mile" at the Flatiron Bootcamp and let me tell you - the struggle has been REAL for this right brained gal! But my hope is that with this vision and passion, I can continue to exercise my left brain and develop the knowledge and skills to build a software that can provide symphony orchestras, musicians, educators the means to communicate effectively and make music accessible to all audiences. I am fearful and excited about where this journey will take me but ready to face its challenges. Wish me luck! :)
